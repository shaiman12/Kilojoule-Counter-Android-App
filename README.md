# Kilojoule-Counter-Android-App
This was my first mobile app that I ever developed. It is a simple kilojoule counting/diary application where a user tracks their exercise and food intakes with specific goals in mind. This was coded in Java with Android Developer Studio

## Deployment
Open and run with Android Studio
